<H1>Introduction</H1>
<p>
In this project, we explore the challenges in maintaining and deploying an object detection model. The main goal of this work is to construct a machine learning system that is robust and strives for simplicity and ease of use. We demo the results of our system in the form of a web application that can easilt be deployed on the google cloud platform given the current repository structure.

This project is currently under construction üèó, below you can find the current status of items we are working on:

MVP
- [x] Process and store Waymo data in Coco format on GCP
- [x] Train preliminary models on Waymo data
- [x] Implement Flask application to serve model results
- [x] Create Streamlit application to display results to users
- [x] Deploy web app and model serving application using kubernetes


Demo
- [ ] Add exploratory features to the web application
- [ ] Enhance the training and evaluation processes (submission of training jobs)
- [ ] Create script to compress and deploy model on Nvidia Jetson Nano
- [ ] Write report
